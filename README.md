This is a bot for instagram, that i wrote on the first of Feburary 2020. It only works with Instagram.

For this bot to work you need chromedriver and chrome, because this is written for chrome.
I've included chromedriver.exe in this repository for you to use

The bot is just a class and can't operate on it's own.


The setup of the bot looks something like this:


import Bot

someUser = Bot.InstaBot(username, password, Chromedriver_Path)
someUser.logi





Thanks for using my bot or just checking it out and feel free to leave comments or improvements

I'm still learning and i'm not perfect, so is this bot. There is a possibility, that there are bugs. If you find any, tell me and i'll try to fix them.

Again thanks for looking at my project and have a good day,

athlalon :)
